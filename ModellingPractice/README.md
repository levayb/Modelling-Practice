\# About

Green Commitment assignment reference solution.

There is a server and a client program included in the code.
Both available in CLI (command-line interface) and GUI (graphical user interface) version.

\#\# Building

Create runnable JARs like this

```
mvn clean verify package
```

This'll create a `green-commitment-jar-with-dependencies.jar` in `target/`.

\#\# Server

Required command-line arguments in order:

1. Mode: `CLI_SERVER` or `GUI_SERVER`
2. Port: the port to listen for connections, e.g. `1234`

Run the server like

```
java @etc/cli-server
```

or

```
java @etc/gui-server
```

Edit the text file to change server parameters.
To run the server from an IDE create a run configuration and supply parameters as seen in the files in `etc/`.

\#\# Client

Required command-line arguments in order:

1. Mode: `CLI_CLIENT` or `GUI_CLIENT`
2. Client ID: the ID of the client, e.g `123`
3. Host: the hostname of the server, e.g. `localhost`
4. Port: the port of the server, e.g. `1234`
5. Interval: the interval in milliseconds to send data to the server, e.g. `3000`
6. Measurement type: the type of data sent by the client, e.g. `TEMPERATURE` or `DISTANCE`
7. Lower bound: lower bound of random value generated by the client, e.g. 30
8. Upper bound: upper bound of random value generated by the client, e.g. 35

Run clients like

```
java @etc/cli-client-1
java @etc/cli-client-2
java @etc/gui-client-3
...
```

Edit the text files to change client parameters.
To run a client from an IDE create a run configuration and supply parameters as seen in the files in `etc/`.
